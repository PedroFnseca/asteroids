## Technical details

Asteroids is built using a combination of pure JavaScript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library (and Maizena). 

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web. I use p5.js for rendering the game graphics, handling collisions (with some math), and creating an overall visually appealing 

And lastly, Maizena. It's not a programming language or a library, it's our secret ingredient! ðŸŒ½ðŸŒ½ðŸŒ½
